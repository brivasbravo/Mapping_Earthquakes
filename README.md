# Mapping_Earthquakes


## Purpose
Purpose of this challenge is to see earthquale data related to tectonic plates movement and
location on earth. We also have to research earthquakes with 4.5 magnitude or larger on the map.

## Resources

Javascript, VS Code, mapbox.com, openstreetmap.org

## Results
### Deliverable 1

Task here is to add tectonic plate data using d3.json(), demonstrate plate linestring data to appear
on the map, add geoJSON layer, and overlay with earthquake data.
